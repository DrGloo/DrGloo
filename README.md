### Hello, my name is Raishan ðŸ‘‹

I work on a lot of different things, including websites, libraries, games, apis and bots!

I'm a self-taught engineer with a passion for learning new things. I love going down the rabbit hole of learning the ins and outs of something that's new and exciting, and taking that experience with me onto the next thing. I also love teaching and helping other engineers with any problems they might have!

I've created or contributed to hundreds of projects using a wide breadth of technologies and patterns that I've learned along the way. I've worked on games, websites (both front end and back end), bots & apis, and all sorts of miscellaneous adventures. I believe that the best results can be achieved when you take experience and wisdom from many different places into account when creating something new.
